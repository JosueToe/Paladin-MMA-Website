# âœ… Build Fixes Summary

## All Build Errors Fixed!

Your site now builds successfully and is ready to deploy to Netlify! ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### 1. **ESLint Errors - Unescaped Characters** (ERRORS - Build Blockers)

Fixed apostrophes and quotes in JSX by wrapping text in JavaScript expressions:

#### Files Fixed:
- âœ… `app/not-found.tsx` - Fixed "you're" and "doesn't"
- âœ… `app/store/page.tsx` - Fixed "You're"  
- âœ… `app/terms/page.tsx` - Fixed "Academy's"
- âœ… `components/sections/About.tsx` - Fixed "don't"
- âœ… `components/sections/ContactLocation.tsx` - Fixed "We'll"
- âœ… `components/sections/Testimonials.tsx` - Fixed double quotes around testimonials

**Example Fix:**
```jsx
// Before (caused error):
<p>You're looking for...</p>

// After (works):
<p>{"You're looking for..."}</p>
```

### 2. **TypeScript Error - Button Component** (ERROR - Build Blocker)

Fixed type conflict between Framer Motion and React button props.

#### File Fixed:
- âœ… `components/ui/Button.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Simplified ButtonProps interface
- Removed prop spreading that caused type conflicts
- Explicitly defined onClick, type, and disabled props

---

### 3. **Image Tag Warnings** (WARNINGS - Not Build Blockers)

Added ESLint disable comments for legitimate use of `<img>` tags in lightbox/modal components.

#### Files Fixed:
- âœ… `components/sections/Gallery.tsx` - Lightbox images
- âœ… `components/sections/Classes.tsx` - Modal images

**Why:** These images are for dynamic lightbox functionality and using `<img>` is appropriate here.

---

### 4. **Removed Unused File** (ERROR - Build Blocker)

Deleted old Netlify function file that was causing TypeScript errors.

#### File Deleted:
- âœ… `netlify/functions/contact.ts`

**Why:** We're using EmailJS for the contact form now, so this file is no longer needed.
